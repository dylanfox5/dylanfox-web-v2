            <p>
              I"m a strong advocate for serving others; choosing to have
              the humility to put others first and care for others. A good leader must first be a good follower.
              These are the foundations of <span>leadership</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuously inventing and reinventing how I can serve others & society. The term
              Futurist is one I often use to describe myself. The future and its possibilities excite me.
              I think our potential as humans are limitless when <span>innovation</span> is at the forefront.
            </p>
            <p>
              The art of understanding an obstacle, how it works, and how it can be overcome, is one
              I find nothing short of beautiful. The leaders that bring forth our future and open its
              possibilities are nothing without the vision of <span>problem-solving</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the ideology I live each day by. Be sure to continue on or follow me on any social media
              to see what that looks like. ðŸš€
